This week's sketch and concept started out as something I just thought would be funnyâ€“ the idea that as you enter your objectives and key results into fields in the UI, the software "lints" your input and gives you feedback akin to a spell-checker.  But in the end, I realized that it actually has a couple of interesting connections to how a tech product delivers core value.

#### OKR Builder (and linter) Concept

Again, this is just a concept, since there are so many subjective qualities to a good OKR (i.e. it's difficult to algorithmically determine if an objective is "attainable, but still ambitious like a stretch goal" or if it aligns with a companies "organizational culture").  And you can see in the sketch below that the example OKR I used is completely contrived.  Then again, if I'm using the spell-checker analogy, a spell checker doesn't make sure your writing is grammatically correct and elegant, so it kind of works.

In the sketch below, the interface is essentially a blank screen (Ã  la Medium) with a field for the user to enter their first objective.  The user would press `<tab>` to jump from the objective to each key result, with new fields appearing as the user progresses (so, no clicking would be required to create 3 objectives with 3 key results).  As the user types, the words are scanned on every keystroke, and feedback is given to the user based on what they've entered.

For example, I've noticed that 99% of objectives that I've seen defined in the OKR pattern begin with a verb (i.e. Increase, Reduce, Improve, Implement, etc.).  So that would be helpful feedback to show the user.  For key results, the possibilities might be even more numerous considering they're a little more quantitative in nature.  In fact, most contain numbers, which is another data-point that an OKR builder could look for in the user's input.

And if I were to imagine this as a config file, similar to those we use in  code linters, it might look something like this, `okr-linter.json`:

```
{
    "no_leading_verb_in_objectives": {
        "level": "error"
    },
    "numbers_in_objectives": {
        "level": "warn"
    },
    "too_many_ands_in_objective": {
        "level": "warn"
    },
    "no_numbers_in_keyresults": {
        "level": "error"
    }
}
```

#### Connecting Some Dots

One of the largest challenges at any tech company is getting people in the door and onboarding.  And, when is comes to [leading causes of churn in SaaS products](http://blog.preact.com/saas-churn-causes-and-prevention), those factors are often huge.  At 7Geese it's especially interesting since we're also selling our customers on the adoption and implementation of the OKR methodology.

A second challenge that any tech company faces is forming some kind of "growth hacking" strategy.  For example, Facebook used the metric of getting users to "10 friends in 14 days" as a benchmark for deciding if users were adequately engaged with the product to enough of a level where they would be retained.

So, to combine those ideas, image this OKR builder tool were set up in such a way that it required the user to create "3 objectives with 3 key results every 3 months", and then guided the user through the process with automatic, instant feedback. ðŸ’¥
