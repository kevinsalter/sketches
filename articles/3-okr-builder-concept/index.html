          <section class="content"><p>This week‚Äôs sketch and concept started out as something I just thought would be funny‚Äì the idea that as you enter your objectives and key results into fields in the <span class="caps">UI</span>, the software ‚Äúlints‚Äù your input and gives you feedback akin to a spell-checker.  But in the end, I realized that it actually has a couple of interesting connections to how a tech product delivers core&nbsp;value.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<h4 id="okr-builder-and-linter-concept"><span class="caps">OKR</span> Builder (and linter)&nbsp;Concept</h4>
<p>Again, this is just a concept, since there are so many subjective qualities to a good <span class="caps">OKR</span> (i.e. it‚Äôs difficult to algorithmically determine if an objective is ‚Äúattainable, but still ambitious like a stretch goal‚Äù or if it aligns with a companies ‚Äúorganizational culture‚Äù).  And you can see in the sketch below that the example OKR I used is completely contrived.  Then again, if I‚Äôm using the spell-checker analogy, a spell checker doesn‚Äôt make sure your writing is grammatically correct and elegant, so it kind of&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>In the sketch below, the interface is essentially a blank screen (√† la Medium) with a field for the user to enter their first objective.  The user would press <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> to jump from the objective to each key result, with new fields appearing as the user progresses (so, no clicking would be required to create 3 objectives with 3 key results).  As the user types, the words are scanned on every keystroke, and feedback is given to the user based on what they‚Äôve&nbsp;entered.</p>
<p>For example, I‚Äôve noticed that 99% of objectives that I‚Äôve seen defined in the <span class="caps">OKR</span> pattern begin with a verb (i.e. Increase, Reduce, Improve, Implement, etc.).  So that would be helpful feedback to show the user.  For key results, the possibilities might be even more numerous considering they‚Äôre a little more quantitative in nature.  In fact, most contain numbers, which is another data-point that an OKR builder could look for in the user‚Äôs&nbsp;input.</p>
<p>And if I were to imagine this as a config file, similar to those we use in  code linters, it might look something like this, <code>okr-linter.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;no_leading_verb_in_objectives&quot;: {
        &quot;level&quot;: &quot;error&quot;
    },
    &quot;numbers_in_objectives&quot;: {
        &quot;level&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;
    },
    &quot;too_many_ands_in_objective&quot;: {
        &quot;level&quot;: &quot;warn&quot;
    },
    &quot;no_numbers_in_keyresults&quot;: {
        &quot;level&quot;: &quot;error&quot;
    }
}
</code></pre><h4 id="connecting-some-dots">Connecting Some&nbsp;Dots</h4>
<p>One of the largest challenges at any tech company is getting people in the door and onboarding.  And, when is comes to <a href="http://blog.preact.com/saas-churn-causes-and-prevention">leading causes of churn in SaaS products</a>, those factors are often huge.  At 7Geese it‚Äôs especially interesting since we‚Äôre also selling our customers on the adoption and implementation of the <span class="caps">OKR</span>&nbsp;methodology.</p>
<p>A second challenge that any tech company faces is forming some kind of ‚Äúgrowth hacking‚Äù strategy.  For example, Facebook used the metric of getting users to ‚Äú10 friends in 14 days‚Äù as a benchmark for deciding if users were adequately engaged with the product to enough of a level where they would be&nbsp;retained.</p>
<p>So, to combine those ideas, image this <span class="caps">OKR</span> builder tool were set up in such a way that it required the user to create ‚Äú3 objectives with 3 key results every 3 months‚Äù, and then guided the user through the process with automatic, instant feedback.&nbsp;üí•</p>
