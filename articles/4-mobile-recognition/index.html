          <section class="content"><p>While there are debates around how a modern employee recognition program might operate, it‚Äôs clear that there is tremendous value in being able to <a href="https://www.officevibe.com/facegame">recognize your colleagues</a>.
<br><br>
‚Ä¶
<br><br>
Seriously though, it‚Äôs obvious that showing appreciation and receiving kudos from teammates builds morale and makes people feel more connected to each other.  But should it be a core focus of a company, or is it just an annoying thing aimed at&nbsp;‚Äòmillennials‚Äô?</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<h4 id="the-7geese-flavour-of-love-recognition">The 7Geese flavour of <del>love</del> recognition</h4>
<p>At 7Geese, recognition badges represent a company‚Äôs core values; awarding badges to colleagues then helps strengthen each person‚Äôs alignment to those&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>I love that simplicity.  It‚Äôs also a really nice parallel to the way OKRs strengthen the alignment of everyone‚Äôs&nbsp;goals.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-recognition-good-for-">What is recognition good&nbsp;for?</h4>
<p>For many 7Geese users, being recognized by a co-worker is a <a href="http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated">‚Äúmagic moment‚Äù</a>‚Äì an instant where a user feels the platform delivering its core value and building its&nbsp;stickiness.</p>
<p>Since recognition can come from anyone (peers, managers, reports) it can help to unify teams, proactively reinforce good performance, and foster a sense of appreciation and belonging across the entire team.  New employees being on-boarded can quickly get a direct sense of what that company is about.  And the public nature of recognition means people are noticing that your work is getting&nbsp;noticed.</p>
<p>Zooming out a bit, the trend of recognition given over a period of time could be an interesting data point for company leaders to help gauge employees‚Äô alignment to the company‚Äôs core&nbsp;values.</p>
<h4 id="arguments-against-recognition-and-way-better-counterarguments-">Arguments against recognition (‚Ä¶and way better&nbsp;counterarguments)</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs also important to define what recognition is <strong>not</strong>‚Äì <em>i.e.</em> it doesn‚Äôt acknowledge any employee‚Äôs tenure, metrics or stats related to their job (there are no leaderboards!), and it‚Äôs not meant to gamify an employee‚Äôs training experience (meaning, you don‚Äôt get a ‚Äòprize‚Äô after each level), for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>That being said, there are still a few arguments we‚Äôve received against recognition‚Äôs&nbsp;effectiveness.</p>
<p>The most reasonable one I‚Äôve heard so far is that it can be annoying at larger companies to see a feed full of recognitions, some of which you may not care about.  There‚Äôs likely a case to be made for allowing users to opt in/out of which recognitions hit their feed and, conversely, if employees wanted to be more private, and limit the publicity of recognitions they have received (even though that kind of defeats the&nbsp;purpose‚Ä¶).</p>
<p>Another complaint is that people are being recognized too frequently, and that it can feel like a bit of a popularity contest.  The answer to this could be as simple as teaching people to ask <em>‚ÄúIs this something that could happen everyday?‚Äù</em>, and if the answer is <em>yes</em>, it‚Äôs not recognition.  Recognition must me authentic and genuine, or else it‚Äôs not worth the pixels on the&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>I also think it‚Äôd be an interesting experiment to limit the frequency of recognitions‚Äì <code>more scarcity == more valuable</code>.  For example, maybe you can only give out 1 recognition per week, or only recognize one person per month.  The purpose wouldn‚Äôt be to limit users, but just ensure some common sense guidelines were being followed.  The details would have to be worked out, but it might help people to give proper consideration before recognizing someone, and make recognitions harder to&nbsp;‚Äòabuse‚Äô.</p>
<p>Finally, there‚Äôs the argument that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a millennial, I don‚Äôt need to be recognized for doing my job.‚Äù  In my opinion, that‚Äôs straight bull$h!t.  But don‚Äôt take my word for it!  Harvard Medical School published an article a few years ago explaining how <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/in-praise-of-gratitude">gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships</a>.  And Harvard is never wrong,&nbsp;so‚Ä¶</p>
<h4 id="is-mobile-the-right-format-">Is mobile the right&nbsp;format?</h4>
<p>Since our Q3 meeting, I‚Äôve been interested in the idea of each module of 7Geese being its own mobile app.  It makes sense, since we have some customers who only use (or only <em>want</em> to use) 7Geese for recognition, or only for 1-on-1s.  So it makes sense to think for a minute about why mobile would be a good format for an individual module like&nbsp;recognition.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, the act of giving recognition is quick and easy to do.  It‚Äôs an impulsive action that doesn‚Äôt require any preparation.  I could be on the SkyTrain on my way home from the office and remember that I wanted to recognize a colleague.  I whip out my phone, and üí•.  That kind of ease would also facilitate timely recognition which, as we know, <a href="http://support.7geese.com/hc/en-us/articles/204411167-Tips-On-Recognizing-a-Teammate">(is more effective)</a>.</p>
<h4 id="some-mobile-best-practices">Some mobile best&nbsp;practices</h4>
<p>Here are a few considerations when designing a mobile&nbsp;experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>elements should be sized appropriately<ul>
<li><em>design for fat fingers, pictorial&nbsp;icons</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://tympanus.net/Development/CardExpansion/">use animations</a>, maybe <a href="http://tympanus.net/Development/AnimatedSVGIcons/"><span class="caps">SVG</span> morphing icons</a>?<ul>
<li><strong>this is supposed to be&nbsp;fun!!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there might be better <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1950">alternatives to&nbsp;dropdowns</a></li>
<li>how does the navigation&nbsp;work?</li>
<li>how many clicks/swipes are required to accomplish a certain task?<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://uxmyths.com/post/654026581/myth-all-pages-should-be-accessible-in-3-clicks">not that that&nbsp;matters?</a></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mobile internet is slow<ul>
<li>is the app simple, and the payload to the browser as small as it can&nbsp;be?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>design patterns: <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/why-cards-are-the-future-of-the-web/">cards</a> vs <a href="http://blog.uxpin.com/6774/5-creative-mobile-ui-patterns-navigation/">grids</a> vs <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/image-vs-list-mobile-navigation/">lists</a></li>
<li>how much of the app can i navigate using only one&nbsp;hand?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-are-some-of-the-screens-we-ll-need-">What are some of the screens we‚Äôll&nbsp;need?</h4>
<ol>
<li>login</li>
<li>navigation<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm leaning towards a fullscreen nav motif throughout the app (i.e. popovers, dialogs, and navigation would all take up the full screen while they‚Äôre being&nbsp;used)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>browse colleagues<ul>
<li><em>also browse departments or&nbsp;teams?</em></li>
<li>choosing a colleague then opens recognition form with the person&nbsp;pre-selected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recognition form (for giving recognition)<ul>
<li><em>recognize individuals, groups, and&nbsp;departments?</em></li>
<li>choose&nbsp;user(s)</li>
<li>write&nbsp;description</li>
<li>choose&nbsp;badge</li>
<li>checkbox: notify recipient‚Äôs manager?&nbsp;department(s)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>list (feed) of recognition given out<ul>
<li><em>ability to filter by person / team /&nbsp;badge</em></li>
<li>each list item links to individual&nbsp;recognition</li>
<li>ability to ‚Äúlike‚Äù or share without having to go to individual recognition (swipe left on&nbsp;iOS)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>individual recognition pages<ul>
<li><em>with&nbsp;comments</em></li>
<li><em>ability to&nbsp;‚Äúlike‚Äù</em></li>
<li><em>social&nbsp;sharing</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>social sharing button‚Äôs overlay/dialog (full&nbsp;screen)</li>
<li>list of available badges with descriptions<ul>
<li>choosing a badge shows the description of that badge (full&nbsp;screen)</li>
<li>when in full screen, there‚Äôs an ‚Äòx‚Äô to close the overlay, and a <span class="caps">CTA</span> button to give that badge to someone, which then opens the recognition form with that badge&nbsp;pre-selected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Admins:</em> create and edit badges<ul>
<li>badge&nbsp;name</li>
<li>description of&nbsp;badge</li>
<li>which departments can use&nbsp;it?</li>
<li>upload an image<ul>
<li><em>by the way, Digital Ocean has <a href="http://drbl.in/mZXI">some really nicely designed core values badges</a>, worth checking&nbsp;out</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
